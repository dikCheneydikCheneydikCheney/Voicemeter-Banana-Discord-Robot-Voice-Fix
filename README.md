# Voicemeter Banana Discord Mic Fix

I've always had this weird issue with Discord and a robotic mic. This happens due to Audiodg.exe, 
setting the Class to 'RealTime' and the Affinity to '1' fixes the issue. 

Basically, this is just a powershell script to fix the issue.

Throw this bad MFer into Task Scheduler (yeah windows im not on arch yet) and watch the 4 lines of elementary grade ""Code"" do it's work.
